# Kickstarter Campaign Outcomes 

##This analysis will cover how the other campaigns did overall in terms of their respective launch dates---
  and funding goals
  - It will also shed light on some flaws the data set might have and some reconmendations it can benefit from

### Purpose
	- To help Louise see how differently the other campaigns did in terms of their launch dates and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges
	-I used a combination of pivoting tables,formulas and data visuals in order to obtain the---
         required results of each data set.
	  -A few challenges were encountered when trying to plug in the right values in the formula for 
	    calculating the number of successful outcomes, but it was eventually resolved
	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	- The line chart reveals that successful outcomes peaked during the months of May and June, while---
	  failed outcomes saw more of a steady pattern thoughout the whole year. Additionally, cancaled outcomes 
	  remained low thoughout the end of the year

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	- The line chart of this data set revealed a mirrored reflection of one another. In that, whenever the--- 
	percentage of successful outcomes rised, the percentage of failed outcomes dipped and vice-versa. This--- 
	created a rather interesting visual.It was also obversed that the percentage of canceled outcomes---
	remained at zero at all times

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	-![countifs_formula](path/to/countifs_formula.png) 
	 - At first, it was difficult to understand the countifs formula, but after---
	   a while, it became easy to use it
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - I concluded that successful outcomes became very apparent in both May and June, surpassing the 100 mark---
    and also that failed outcomes never got above the 60 mark

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - The percentage of successful and failed outcomes varied greatly across the table and they mirrored---
    each other, intertwining at a few points in the line graph

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - I feel that only using the months for this data set is limiting the overall results,---
    as opposed to having quaterly dates for multiple years

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A clustered bar graph could also be used to better illustrate and compare the successful and failed---
    outcomes side-by-side.
    - The chart could also use more labels to indicate certain aspects of the visuals
